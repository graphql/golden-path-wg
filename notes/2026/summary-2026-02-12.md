The GraphQL Golden Path working group held its initial meeting to discuss the specification and implementation of best practices for GraphQL libraries and frameworks. The group debated the scope and audience of the Golden Path, with Benjie proposing it as a set of default behaviors for library authors to minimize common issues like the N+1 problem. Mark and Pascal raised concerns about making batched execution the default, arguing it could break existing patterns and implementation styles. The group also discussed the need for clear terminology around different types of APIs and agreed to consider multiple entry points for the Golden Path, including one for library implementers and others for schema designers. They concluded by reviewing the draft document on goldenpass.benjie.dev and discussing the potential for compatibility acceptance tests for gaps in the specification.

## Next Steps

- All participants: Review the draft Golden Path document at goldenpass.benjie.dev and provide feedback
- All participants: Start identifying and compiling problems that can be solved out-of-the-box for users, for discussion at the next meeting
- All participants: Consider and provide input on potential additional "Golden Path" entry points for different roles (e.g., schema designers, library implementers)
- Benjie and TSC: Move the Golden Path draft document to the GraphQL organization's repository
- All participants: Begin thinking about what specific problems can be technologically solved by default to prevent users from having to read documentation about them (to be discussed at next meeting)

## Summary

### GraphQL Golden Path Kickoff

The GraphQL Golden Path working group held its initial meeting, with Benjie introducing the meeting and guidelines for participation. Attendees discussed the agenda and their familiarity with the meeting materials, with Michael mentioning he had reviewed 10% of the talks and Martin sharing his approach to reviewing content. The group agreed to start with introductions in the order listed on the agenda, with Benjie noting that additional participants could join at the end.

### GraphQL Golden Path Initiative

The working group discussed the purpose of defining and documenting an opinionated set of practices to help new users of GraphQL succeed with the technology. Benjie introduced the concept of the "Golden Path," aiming to address common issues that users encounter, such as overfetching, information leakage, and the M+1 problem. The group agreed on the importance of promoting these best practices across various GraphQL tools and software. Benjie encouraged participants to contribute to the initiative and apply for grants if needed.

### GraphQL Golden Path Discussion

The team discussed the concept of "Golden Path" versus best practices in GraphQL, with Benjie clarifying that Golden Path refers to default behaviors in libraries that automate best practices, while best practices are guidelines for developers to follow. They agreed that both unobjectionable best practices (like using trusted documents) and more opinionated guidance should be provided, with Michael suggesting the need to better define terms like "public" and "private" APIs. The discussion concluded with Benjie outlining different audience segments: application developers for best practices and schema design, and library authors for the Golden Path, while also mentioning the need for how-to guides and documentation improvements on GraphQL.org.

### API Documentation Best Practices

Benjie discussed the importance of clearly defining API terminology, particularly distinguishing between first-party (internal) and third-party (consumed by others) APIs. He emphasized that documentation should be opinionated but not restrictive, advocating for batched execution as a recommended practice without specifying the implementation method. Pascal agreed with being specific in library documentation but suggested being more explicit about recommended patterns in GraphQL server building guidelines.

### Batch Resolver vs DataLoader Trade-offs

Benjie discussed the trade-offs between using DataLoader and batch resolvers, emphasizing that DataLoader requires users to learn and opt into its use, which can lead to performance issues like the N+1 problem if not implemented consistently. He argued that the "Golden Path" should aim to minimize downsides rather than maximize upsides, advocating for batch resolvers as a more user-friendly alternative that effectively solves the N+1 problem by default. Benjie concluded that while users should have the option to use DataLoader if they choose, the goal is to make the least effort path lead to success in the long term.

### Golden Path Documentation Audience Discussion

The team discussed the intended audience for the "Golden Path" documentation, which aims to provide default practices and tooling options for both library/framework authors and end users. Benjie explained that the document is being developed as a specification for library authors, outlining recommended default settings and experiences for users, with examples like complexity analysis and maximum token settings. Mark inquired about the placement of opinionated guidelines, such as schema design, within the Golden Path model, and Benjie clarified that these would be part of best practices documentation.

### Golden Path Documentation Audience Discussion

Benjie and Mark discussed the audience for documentation related to a "Golden Path" initiative. Benjie clarified that the target audience is not application developers but rather end users and library maintainers. They agreed that the Golden Path could include documentation for library authors, while separate documentation might be needed for application developers. Benjie suggested creating an entry page to determine the user's role and provide relevant documentation accordingly.

### GraphQL Golden Path Discussion

The meeting focused on discussing the Golden Path for GraphQL, with Benjie presenting a draft document outlining recommended practices and defaults. The group debated whether batched execution should be the default behavior, with Pascal expressing concerns about breaking established patterns while Benjie argued for minimizing the downsides of the N+1 problem. They agreed to move the draft document to the GraphQL organization and for participants to brainstorm additional problems that could be solved out of the box. The concept of different Golden Paths for different stakeholders was introduced, with Benjie requesting input on other entry points.
